                            <a>How hackers Bypass Locked Windows Computers to Run Kali Linux from a Live USB</a>
                            <p>It’s easy to run Kali Linux from a live USB on nearly any available computer, but many publicly accessible laptops and desktops will be locked down to prevent such use. School, work, or library PCs can be secured with a BIOS
                                password, which is often an easily recovered default password. Once you have access, though, you can use a USB flash drive to run Kali live on any PC you find.</p>

                            </a>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>With a Kali live USB stick, you can run a hacking OS on any machine you can plug into, meaning you don’t have to dedicate your personal computer or a portion of it for your hacking adventures, nor do you need to buy a PC just
                                to use Kali with. A live USB allows the resources of the computer to be used to boot from the thumb drive, ignoring the hard drive the computer usually boots from. When running Kali from a USB stick, there are two different
                                ways of doing so. One is persistent, meaning changes that you make are saved to the flash drive. The other is non-persistent, where no changes are saved any anything you do is lost when you exit the session. If you don’t
                                need to store files or remember settings you’ve changed, you can simply run the installation in live mode and enjoy the benefits of a fresh system every time you start. If persistence is a necessary feature, you can take
                                the extra steps needed to make your installation persistent.</p>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>While computers can be found almost everywhere nowadays, it’s rare to find one for public use that isn’t protected in some way. Most school and work computers have layers of defenses, usually requiring a login, and some features
                                deemed risky could be disabled. An example of one of these features is changing the boot order in the BIOS menu to allow booting from a USB stick. The BIOS, or Basic Input/Output System, is the configuration menu which
                                can be run at the beginning of booting a computer. This system runs before the operating system and does things like tells the computer which input device to search first for an operating system to boot from. If the BIOS
                                is unlocked, changing the boot order to have the computer attempt to boot from USB first takes only a few seconds with the on-screen menu, which can usually be accessed by pressing F2 while starting the computer. However,
                                as mentioned before, most publicly accessible computers will have a BIOS password set. This password, sometimes called an administrator password, will be required to switch the boot order, making it much harder for the
                                average user to run Kali on a computer they have access to. If the BIOS password is set to a strong password, it can be extremely difficult to modify the system in any meaningful way. Fortunately for a hacker, many PCs
                                simply use a default password on the BIOS, which can be derived easily from the serial number. This allows a hacker to bypass the BIOS password to change the boot order to allow Kali Linux to run on the system. We’ll explore
                                how this works, so you can determine if a computer is using a default BIOS password and bypass it.</p>

                            <br><br>
                            <p>To try this attack, you’ll need to use a computer that has a version of Windows running on it. The boot system of macOS doesn’t use a BIOS-type interface, so you won’t be able to execute this kind of attack against a Linux
                                or macOS device. Once you have a test computer, you’ll need to create a bootable USB image of Kali Linux. You’ll need a USB stick with at least 16 GB of space on it, although more is advised if you want a persistent installation
                                which allows you to save files or data.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>To begin, download Kali Linux from kali.org/downloads, taking care to download the appropriate version for the computer you’re going to be using. Generally, the 64-bit version should be fine.</p>

                            <p>Once this file has been downloaded, you’ll need to burn it to a USB flash drive using Etcher (download). This free, cross-platform program can turn the Kali image into a bootable USB stick. Make sure there are no files on the
                                thumb drive you are using because it will be erased in the process. Insert the USB drive into your computer, then open Etcher. Inside Etcher, you’ll need to supply two pieces of information: the image to write and the drive
                                to write the image to. For the option on the far left, select the Kali image you downloaded, then hit “Select drive” to choose your thumb drive. Make sure you’re selecting the correct drive because after you click the “Flash”
                                button, the selected drive will be erased. Click “Flash,” and the process will begin, first burning the data to the drive, and then verifying the burned image. When this is done, you can safely eject the drive.</p>

                            <p>Now that the USB stick is ready, booting into Kali is fairly simple if you’re able to access the boot order settings. First, you’ll need to identify the key to press when you reboot the computer which accesses the BIOS menu.
                                My HP computer allows access to this menu by hitting Esc, but for many other desktop PCs, the key is F2.</p>

                                - If you try F2 and see a diagnostics tool, the BIOS key is likely F10. <br>- If the boot menu opens for F10, it's likely F2.</p>

                            <p>From within the BIOS system, you’ll need to look for the “boot order” or “boot menu.” When you’ve located this, you’ll need to change the order that the computer looks for devices to boot from. If there is no password, this
                                is the step in which you can simply change the boot order so that the USB drive comes before the hard drive, and you’re done!</p>

                                to generate a default password.</p>

                            <p>Now that you have the default BIOS password, you can access the entire BIOS menu. This gives you full access to the hardware settings of the computer, and you can do pretty much whatever you want at this point. To start, you
                                can disable the BIOS password, set a new admin password, or do things like apply firmware updates. In this case, you probably won’t need to do any of this. Attempting to change the boot order should give you a password
                                prompt, and once you supply the default password, you should be able to switch the boot order to make the “USB” option first, as seen above in Step 3. If this doesn’t work, you can also navigate to the security settings
                                and attempt to log in there. Once you supply the default password, you can proceed to either disable or change it, allowing you to proceed to the boot order settings and change it to run USB first.</p>

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <p>Now that you’ve bypassed the BIOS password and changed the boot order, insert the Kali live USB stick, and reboot the computer. The first place the computer should now look is the USB port for a system to boot from, but in
                                the future, if there is no bootable system plugged into the USB drive, it will just proceed to boot from the hard drive as usual. Once the system starts, you will be taken to the Kali setup screen. Here, you’ll be able
                                to pick which version of Kali you want to run on the system. You can select a live version, which will not save any data to the disk, or a persistent version, which will allow you to save files and settings to the disk.</p>
