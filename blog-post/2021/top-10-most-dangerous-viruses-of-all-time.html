                            <p>Computer viruses are simply malicious programs or malware that “infect” other system files with the intention of modifying or damaging them. This type of infection generally consists of embedding its malicious code inside the
                                “victim” file (usually an executable) so that from that moment said executable becomes the carrier of the virus and therefore, a new source of infection. There are different types of computer viruses that can be classified
                                according to their origin, the techniques they use, the types of files they infect, where they hide, the type of damage they cause, or the type of operating system or platform they attack.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>By simply uploading a ransom note, and/or an encrypted file (preferably both for best results), the site will use several techniques to help identify what ransomware may have encrypted the files. This includes assessing the
                                ransom note name, file name patterns of the encrypted file, and in some cases, even byte patterns in the encrypted file itself.</p>

                            <p>These viruses infect multiple parts of the system at the same time. Example: Boot Sector as well as *.EXE files. A hybrid virus usually combines the approaches of the two types (file infection virus and boot record virus) in
                                order to maximize damage and resistance to removal. Ghostball was the first multipartite virus, discovered by Fridrik Skulason in October 1989.

                            <p>These escape anti-virus software by intercepting the anti-virus software calls to the OS and pointing it to the actual virus which provides a clean copy of the requested program to the anti-virus software. The term stealth
                                virus is also used in medicine, to describe a biological virus that hides from the host immune system.
                            </p>
                            <p>Virus coders mainly use the stealth approach to elude virus scanners. In general, a stealth virus will hide itself in system memory every time a program scanner is run. It employs various techniques to hide any changes so that
                                when the scanner looks for altered sections, the virus redirects it to any area that contains the clean, uninfected data.

                            <p>These modify directory entries and point system processes to virus code, then the actual program, leading to the execution of the virus code. As usual, the virus executes itself first and then hands over the control to the
                                file, the execution of which was requested.

                            <p>One prominent example of a cluster virus is the Dir-2 virus. This is sometimes classified as a “stealth” virus because of some of its natural protections. This virus is commonly attributed to Bulgaria, and attacks various types
                                of executable files.

                            <p>This type of virus can cause serious problems if you don’t know it’s there. While the virus is in memory, it controls access to the directory structure on the disk. If you boot from a clean floppy disk, however, and then run
                                a utility such as CHKDSK the utility will report serious problems with cross-linked files on your disk.

                            <p>These are viruses which transform themselves while keeping the original intention intact. These have mutation engines which enable them to mutate to various forms. The first known polymorphic virus was called 1260, or V2PX,
                                and it was created in 1990 as part of a research project. </p>
                            <p>Polymorphic viruses are usually distributed via spam, infected sites, or through the use of other malware. URSNIF, VIRLOCK, VOBFUS, and BAGLE or UPolyX are some of the most notorious polymorphic viruses in existence.</p>
