                            <p>Learn Termux for hacking !! first, understand what is Termux and follow how to install applications using Termux and the complete Termux command. In this article, I am going to give you detailed information and everything that
                                you need to know about Termux. So Let’s get started.</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <a>
                                What is Termux?
                            </a>
                            <br>
                            <p>What is Termux? Basically, Termux is a terminal emulator application for Android as well as a Linux environment that runs on Android without the need for rooting or special settings. Additional applications/packages are also
                                available and can be installed using the APT package manager.
                            </p>

                            <p>What distinguishes Termux from other terminal emulators is that Termux has set up such a way that the environment on Termux is the same as the Debian standard Linux environment. Because the Android environment is different
                                from the Linux environment in general so that in Thermux we can install packages/applications commonly used on Linux in general. With features and environment adjustments like the above makes Termux very special because
                                you can install Penetration Testing Tools (pen-testing tool) / hacking applications such as Metasploit and net hunter times on your Android phone using Termux.
                            </p>
                            <p>Termux also provides a package manager (APT) to make it easier for you to find and install the packages needed from the software repository that Termux provides.</p>
                            <br>
                            <hr>
                            <p>In a Linux distribution, a “package” refers to a compressed file archive that contains all the files that make up a particular application. The files are usually stored in packages according to the existing installation path.
                                Common types of Linux packages such as .deb, .rpm, and .tgz</p>
                            <br><br>

                            <a href="setup">Android is Linux</a>
                            <p>We are getting to know Android first, which is your operating system to run the TERMUX application. Android is a Linux-based operating system that is made for touch screen devices and handheld devices such as the cellphone
                                that you are currently using. Android is made and developed by Google, Android is made from modifying the Linux kernel and other opensource applications. This variant of Android is also used on other types of mobile devices
                                such as game consoles, digital cameras, attendance machines, smart TVs, and other electronic devices.</p>

                            <br>
                            <hr>
                            <p> So the Android cellphone that you currently hold is a Linux. Linux is famous for its powerful reputation, OS server, internet life, and hacking.</p>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            <p>A terminal emulator is an application that provides a text-based interface (CLI) to access the shell To make it easier to access the Linux shell (Shell CLI) from the GUI, a terminal emulator is created, with the terminal emulator
                                you can access the console shell from the GUI shell you are currently using, so it’s easier. Termux is a terminal emulator for Android that allows users to access your Android Linux shell from the GUI.</p>

                            <p>The environment variable is the name of an object that contains data used by one or more applications. In short, this is a variable with a name and value. The contents of the name of this variable can contain information on
                                environment definitions in the system, for example, the location of executable files and file settings in a system, the default editor that must be used, or the local system settings. Laymen might think this is not important,
                                but this variable environment provides a fast and simple way to share settings/configurations of applications and processes on Linux. Linux distro environment, in general, is different from the android environment, running
                                Linux applications in different environments will cause errors, very basic differences between general Linux and android include:
                            </p>
                            <br>

                                    <p>Public folders such as / bin, / etc, / usr, / tmp and / var do not exist.</p>

                                        The android directory structure does not follow the standard rules of the Linux directory structure in general. For example, in general, Linux binary files exist in / bin while in android/system/bin.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>In the standard / general Linux folder ($ HOME) is created for each user in / home/username (multi-user), while in the android folder ($ HOME) is in the subdirectory of the application, so each application has its own
                                        folder ($ HOME) -alone. So avoid storing important data in the folder ($ HOME) when using TERMUX, because this folder will be deleted if TERMUX is uninstalled.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p> Termux installs the package in the directory based on the $PREFIXenvironment variable definition (example: binaries are in $PREFIX/bin, and configuration files $PREFIX/etc). To view the contents of the $ PREFIX variable
                                        you can type echo $ PREFIX in your TERMUX terminal.
                                    </p>

                                </li>

                                    <p>Shared libraries are installed at $ PREFIX/lib, which has been defined in the $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable. This might clash with the Android system binaries in / system/bin, which can force LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be removed
                                        before running the system binaries.
                                    </p>

                                    <p> In addition to the different android file systems with Linux in general, TERMUX is run by a single user without root access (Each android application is run by the user himself), so running Linux commands on TERMUX
                                        will not affect other applications.
                                    </p>

                            <p>Running an application using a non-root user causes ports below 1024 to be unusable (to be able to use ports under 1024 on Linux it must be with the root user). As a solution, many packages have been configured to use port
                                values ​​above 1024 as default values ​​in the Android environment.</p>

                            <p>A shell is an interface used by users to interact with the operating system, generally a shell in the form of a Command-Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The type of shell that you use on your Android
                                Linux mobile every day is a GUI shell because with a GUI shell everyone can use it easily. While the intended shell on Linux is a Shell in the Command-Line Interface (CLI) version, not a GUI, even though Linux already has
                                a desktop/graphics like your android but the desktop version of the GUI is not the shell in question, because if you want to use 100% of Linux potential you must access it through the CLI. When using TERMUX you will access
                                the CLI shell and are required to type the command/text as the only way to interact with your android Linux through the shell.

                                accessed from Termux can be used for several things depending on the needs and skills of its users, for example by programmers/developers used as an environment to test applications that are being developed while by security
                                experts can be used as platforms or tools and hacking tools that are very portable.

                            <p>Termux is one of the terminal emulator applications, the main function of Termux is to provide a text-based interface (command-line interface) to access the Android Linux shell from a graphical user interface. What makes Termux
                                special is that Thermux develops techniques so that standard Linux applications can be installed and run on Android and also provides its own software repository.

                                they try because Termux provides access to the android shell. To support the software developer TERMUX has provided many compilers such as Clang, Rust, Go, etc. and interpreters such as Bash, Perl, Python, etc. You can

                            <p>In the past, if you wanted to hack you had to use a laptop that had a Linux operating system installed, with Termux you can directly use your cell phone as a hacking tool because Android is one of the Linux variants. Termux
                                provides software repositories, and there are already tools for hacking that you can use to facilitate testing/auditing of security systems such as hydra, Nmap, Metasploit, net hunter times, etc. I do not teach hacking
                                / cracking whether requested or not. REMEMBER !! Hacking without permission is illegal and can get you jailed. The above tool should be used only to test/audit the system to find security holes/bugs/vulnerabilities and
                                patch it to improve the security system not to be used for the purpose of damaging or exploiting the system for its own benefit. Be careful with “hacking tutorials using Termux” which are very suspicious where users are
                                told to install applications/scripts that are unclear which ultimately makes your Android phone that was hacked. Most tutorials like that only clickbait/tricks and will not work in the real world. The smooth hacking tutorial
                                using TERMUX only forces the user to install malware on your Android phone that can make your Android phone hit or broken.

                                as the Linux Command. The Termux command is identical to the Linux command especially the Debian family Linux such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint, this is because of the Termux functions as a terminal emulator that accesses the
                                Linux shell on your android mobile.

                                size of the letters, not the sound. make sure you type all commands in the lower case format or all commands are written in all lowercase.

                            <p>When learning Termux for the first time you will definitely encounter an error “storage permission denied” because Teermux does not have permission to access storage (internal and external storage). To overcome this, make sure
                                your Termux has been given permission/permission to access SDCard / storage. If you have not run the command, <b>Termux-setup-storage</b> select allow/allow if a dialog popup appears. Or you can go to the settings menu

                            <p>Termux is just an application that is used to access the Linux shell on your Android, Termux is not only used as a hacking tool, more than that it can be used for other purposes according to the user’s computer expertise. it’s
                                true that with the Termux hacking activities can be more flexible, if in the past hacking people had to bring a laptop that was installed Linux, now you can use the Android cellphone installed with Termux to do hacking
                                activities.
